# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ have the same number of nodes and are
completely connected, they must be isomorphic. I have started with the formal
definition of isomorphism below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

Assuming that $A = (V_1, E_1)$ and $B = (V_2, E_2)$ are two graphs with the same number of nodes and are both completely connected.

Then  $\exists f$ such that $f: A \rightarrow B$ we'll see that the each node in A will map to each node in B since they share the same number of nodes.  Now since both
